<summary><h4>Install Nexus using Yum</h4></summary>

## Prerequisite steps:
* Rocky Linux 8

Guide [How to install Rocky Linux 8.6](https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/8_6_installation/)

## Installation steps:
### 1. Install Sonatype Nexus 3 repo and Nexus 3 itself

following the steps from https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-repository-installer#yum-setup

### 2. Fine-tune the memory requirements
If it is necessary (nexus service is not starting due to insufficient memory volume) - please increase the volume of Memory on your machine.

If it is not an option for you, you can try to edit the file `${installation-directory}/bin/nexus.vmoptions` and decrease the value of `Xms`, `Xmx` and `XX:MaxDirectMemorySize` flags (by default they have `2703m`):

```
-Xms512m
-Xmx512m
-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=512m
```

### 3. Enable and start Nexus 3 service

via `sudo systemctl enable nexus-repository-manager --now`

### 4. Login to Nexus as `admin`.

To ensure the system begins with a secure state, Nexus Repository Manager generates a unique random password during the system’s initial startup which it writes to the data directory (in our case it's "sonatype-work/nexus3") in a file called admin.password.

So you can use the value from this file:

`sudo cat /opt/sonatype/sonatype-work/nexus3/admin.password`

And then go to http://your_host:8081/ in your browser to log in as "admin" user using the password from the file above.

<summary><h4>Install Nexus manually</h4></summary>

## Prerequisite steps:

* Install wget utility in case if you don't have it:
```
sudo yum install wget -y

```

* Install OpenJDK 1.8 in case if you don't have it (to check the version run "java -version")
```
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64 -y
```

## Installation steps:

**1) Move to your /opt directory**
```
cd /opt
```

**2) Download the latest version of Nexus**

You can get the latest download links for nexus from [here](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/product-information/download) (for example, *https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.38.1-01-unix.tar.gz*)
```
sudo wget -O nexus.tar.gz https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/latest-unix.tar.gz
```

**3) Extract the tar file**
```
sudo tar -xvzf nexus.tar.gz
```
You should see two directories: nexus files directory (it's name is "nexus-3.20.1-01" at the screenshot below) and nexus data directory (it's name is "sonatype-work" at the screenshot below).

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203735846-686fd7d2-9ffb-4d43-8c44-febcad94cc4c.png)

Rename the nexus files directory
```
sudo mv nexus-3* nexus
```

**4) Create new user which will run the service**

As a good security practice, it is not advised to run nexus service with root privileges. So create a new user named "nexus" to run the nexus service
```
sudo adduser nexus
```

Change the ownership of nexus files directory and nexus data directory to nexus user
```
sudo chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/nexus
sudo chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/sonatype-work
```

**5) Edit "nexus.rc" file**

Open /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc file
```
sudo vi  /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc
```

Uncomment run_as_user parameter and set it as follows
```
run_as_user="nexus"
```

**6) Edit "nexus.vmoptions"**

I've notices that the service is not starting at all without any logging in case if it's not enough memory to start.

If it is necessary - please increase the volume of Memory on your machine.

If it is not an option for you, you can decrease values of `-Xms`, `-Xmx` and `XX:MaxDirectMemorySize` in `nexus.vmoptions` file.

Open the file in editor

```
sudo vi /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.vmoptions
```

And decrease the `-Xms`, `-Xmx` and `XX:MaxDirectMemorySize` values. By default they are set to `2703m`.

In case if you need to change the default nexus data directory You need to adjust the `-Dkaraf.data` value .

Below are the values I've used in my setup:
```
-Xms512m
-Xmx512m
-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=512m
-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions
-XX:+LogVMOutput
-XX:LogFile=../sonatype-work/nexus3/log/jvm.log
-XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow
-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
-Dkaraf.home=.
-Dkaraf.base=.
-Dkaraf.etc=etc/karaf
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=etc/karaf/java.util.logging.properties
-Dkaraf.data=../sonatype-work/nexus3
-Dkaraf.log=../sonatype-work/nexus3/log
-Djava.io.tmpdir=../sonatype-work/nexus3/tmp
-Dkaraf.startLocalConsole=false
-Djdk.tls.ephemeralDHKeySize=2048
-Dinstall4j.pidDir=/opt/tmp
-Djava.endorsed.dirs=lib/endorsed
```

**7) Start the service**

You can configure the repository manager to run as a service with "init.d" or "systemd".

Both these methods you can find described at the following [page](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/installation-and-upgrades/run-as-a-service).

In this guide we will use "update-rc.d" - a tool that targets the initscripts in "init.d" to run the nexus service.

Symlink "opt/nexus/bin/nexus" to "/etc/init.d/nexus":
```
sudo ln -s /opt/nexus/bin/nexus /etc/init.d/nexus
```

Then activate the service
```
cd /etc/init.d
sudo update-rc.d nexus defaults
sudo service nexus start
```

**Note:** default settings of Port and Host values which nexus uses once the service is started can be found in "/opt/nexus/etc/nexus-default.properties":

**Post install:** Login as admin to Nexus

To ensure the system begins with a secure state, Nexus Repository Manager generates a unique random password during the system's initial startup which it writes to the data directory (in our case it's "sonatype-work/nexus3") in a file called admin.password.

So you can use the value from this file:
```
sudo vi /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/admin.password
```

And then go to http://your_host:8081/ in your browser to log in as "admin" user using the password from the file above.

<summary><h4>Run Nexus as a Docker container</h4></summary>

## 

You can find instructions at: [https://github.com/sonatype/docker-nexus3](https://github.com/sonatype/docker-nexus3)

Link to the Nexus3 image on dockerhub: [https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/nexus3/](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/nexus3/)

### Mount a host directory as the volume

Use the following commands to create a directory for persistent data and change its owner to UID 200 (cause this directory needs to be writable by the Nexus process, which runs as UID 200 - this can be checked in Dockerfile):

```
mkdir nexus-data && sudo chown -R 200 nexus-data
```

### Run the docker container

You can use command similar to the following to run the container: 

```
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus -v ~/Projects/docker-nexus3/nexus-data:/nexus-data sonatype/nexus3
```

**Volume:** Note that `volume` value should contain an absolute path to the directory we've created in a previous step, in my case it's `~/Projects/docker-nexus3/nexus-data`, 
so that's why the volume is mapped the following way: `-v ~/Projects/docker-nexus3/nexus-data:/nexus-data`. 

**Port:** As you may know (or not), Nexus service is running by default on `8081` port; this port can be used to access Nexus UI as well as access some API endpoints. 
But this port is only available inside the docker container, if we are running Nexus in Docker.
So, in order to have an ability to access the service outside the docker container (from our local machine), we need to forward the port via `-p 8081:8081` flag.

<details>
<summary><h5>[CLICK HERE] If you want to take into account in advance port forwarding for Docker HTTP connectors</h5></summary>

##

Let's assume that we have to setup `Docker Proxy` and `Docker Hosted` repositories and then add them to a single `Docker Group` repository.

Of course, as the result we should have an ability to `pull` images from `Docker Group` repository and `push` our custom images to the `Docker Hosted` repository.

In order to do that, we need to have access to `Docker Group` and `Docker Hosted` repositories' HTTP connectors (spoiler: docker repositories can have a separate HTTP connectors set up, more info you can find at the section of `Setup Docker repositories` down below).

So, let's assume that I'm going to setup HTTP connectors for `Docker Group` and `Docker Hosted` repos as `8183` and `8182` respectively.

Hence, our start command should be changed to the following one: 

```
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -p 8182:8182 -p 8183:8183 --name nexus -v ~/Projects/docker-nexus3/nexus-data:/nexus-data sonatype/nexus3
```

Where to existing flag `-p 8081:8081` the following flags are added: `-p 8182:8182 -p 8183:8183`

More info about  to assign port forwarding for *existing* docker container: [link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26622041)

##

</details>
 


There is an environment variable that is being used to pass JVM arguments to the startup script `INSTALL4J_ADD_VM_PARAMS`, passed to the Install4J startup script; it defaults to `-Xms2703m -Xmx2703m -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=2703m -Djava.util.prefs.userRoot=${NEXUS_DATA}/javaprefs`.

This can be adjusted at runtime, so if you want for example to decrease values of `-Xms`, `-Xmx` and `XX:MaxDirectMemorySize`, then your script to run the container would be:

```
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus -e INSTALL4J_ADD_VM_PARAMS="-Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=512m -Djava.util.prefs.userRoot=${NEXUS_DATA}/javaprefs" -v ~/Projects/docker-nexus3/nexus-data:/nexus-data sonatype/nexus3
```

It can take some time (2-3 minutes) for the service to launch in a new container.

You can tail the log to determine once Nexus is ready:

```
docker logs -f nexus
```

### Login to Nexus as `admin`.

To ensure the system begins with a secure state, Nexus Repository Manager generates a unique random password during the system’s initial startup which it writes to the data directory (inside docker container in "/opt/sonatype-work/nexus3") in a file called admin.password.

You can access this file in a persistent data directory:

`cat nexus-data/admin.password`

And then go to http://your_host:8081/ in your browser to log in as "admin" user using the password from the file above.

Official documentation from Sonatype on how to proxy Docker: [link](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/docker-registry/proxy-repository-for-docker)

List of most common remote registries for docker images:

```
https://registry-1.docker.io
https://quay.io
https://gcr.io
https://ghcr.io
```

Example below describes how to setup a proxy for `https://registry-1.docker.io` in particular.

Go to "server administration and configuration" section -> Choose "repositories" option on the left sidebar, then click "create repository" button at the very top of the screen -> Choose "docker (proxy)" type

![9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203739210-e7927164-4cda-4673-b299-80e825d91e94.png)

1) Provide the name of proxy

2) Check the "HTTP" checkbox and provide a Port value you may use for this repository (at the screenshot it's 8181). 
This port can be used to access this repository directly as an API endpoint. More info about connectors can be found [here](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/docker-registry/ssl-and-repository-connector-configuration).
So, if your Nexus instance is running inside of Docker container, or it is running on a separate VM behind a firewall, you would need to ensure that this port is available outside (from your local machine), and open it or forward if needed.

4) Check "allow anonymous docker pull"

5) Provide the URL of the remote storage (for example, https://registry-1.docker.io). Note: each proxy repository can use only one remote storage

6) For the Docker index, select Use Docker Hub

7) Check "Allow Nexus Repository Manager to download and cache foreign layers" checkbox (info: [link](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/docker-registry/foreign-layers)). Remain the regexp by default

8) Please don't forget to apply to the repository the cleanup policy which has been created at the [Post-Install steps] -> [Create Cleanup policies for each types of repo] section of this guide

![10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203739321-f299e06f-32ed-416f-8305-819c1b335cd0.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Setup Hosted Docker repository</h4></summary>

#
If you want to have an ability to push your own Docker images to the Nexus, you would need to have Hosted Repository set up.

The creation of Hosted Docker repository in Nexus is pretty similar to the Proxy Docker repository set up described above.

The differences are that:

1) When choosing the repository type to be created, choose "docker (hosted)"

2) Provide a name of repository, choose the blobstore (or remain it default) and apply a cleanup policy if needed (it should be set up as at the [Post-Install steps] -> [Create Cleanup policies for each types of repo] section of this guide)

3) Don't forger to provide a HTTP connector at specified port as at the screenshot below. The port should be different from other HTTP connector ports specified for other created repos.
This port can be used to access this repository directly as an API endpoint. More info about connectors can be found [here](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/docker-registry/ssl-and-repository-connector-configuration).
So, if your Nexus instance is running inside of Docker container, or it is running on a separate VM behind a firewall, you would need to ensure that this port is available outside (from your local machine), and open it or forward if needed.


![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203739440-3ea5c732-332d-472e-b5f3-ba9cb7de2b2c.png)

Then you will be able to push your own images to such repository.
Example of pushing to Docker hosted repo can be found at the **"Client configuration & How to use"** section below

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Setup Group Docker repository</h4></summary>

#
Several Docker repositories can be grouped in order to simplify access if you're going to use different remote repos at the same time.
For more details please refer to the [guide](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/docker-registry/grouping-docker-repositories) .

In our case, Nexus contains the Docker Group repository which includes all the Proxy Docker repos and Hosted Docker repo.

You should need to provide an unused port value to `HTTP connector` field which going forward can be used to access this repository directly as an API endpoint. More info about connectors can be found [here](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/docker-registry/ssl-and-repository-connector-configuration).
So, if your Nexus instance is running inside of Docker container, or it is running on a separate VM behind a firewall, you would need to ensure that this port is available outside (from your local machine), and open it or forward if needed.
So, accessing the only one HTTP connector of Group repository, we will be able to **download** any image from all these repos (please **note** that Nexus Repository OSS **does not support pushing** into a group repository, so only pulling from group repository is available. Explicit push to the hosted repository is described in the **"Client configuration & How to use"** section below):

![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203739670-68f46b50-bc81-4ef5-a639-82b9d60c7335.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Client configuration & How to use</h4></summary>

#

1) Go to /etc/docker/daemon.json and change it's content as follows:
```
{ "features" : { "buildkit": true},
"insecure-registries": ["nexus_address:http_connector_group_repo", "http://nexus_address:http_connector_group_repo", "nexus_address:http_connector_hosted_repo", "http://nexus_address:http_connector_hosted_repo"],
"registry-mirrors": ["http://nexus_address:http_connector_group_repo", "http://nexus_address:http_connector_hosted_repo"],
"debug": true
 }

```

for example, in my case it would be:

```
{ "features" : { "buildkit": true}, 
"insecure-registries": ["localhost:8183", "http://localhost:8183", "localhost:8182", "http://localhost:8182"], 
"registry-mirrors": ["http://localhost:8183", "http://localhost:8182"], 
"debug": true 
 }
```

2) Create a file /etc/default/docker and put the following line:

```
DOCKER_OPTS="--config-file=/etc/docker/daemon.json"
```

![13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203739818-5e761286-6e4c-4571-8cda-f9f97ff3b87a.png)

3) Go to **~/.docker/config.json**. In case if it contains a record with docker.io, delete it (otherwise docker will work with docker hub instead of proxy)

4) Restart the docker service:

```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Run docker info command:

```
docker info
```

At the bottom you should see records similar to the following:

![14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203763787-be8f39eb-080b-4172-9f4a-5b2f5cdf03a3.png)

Now if you run in your console:

```
docker pull sonatype/centos-rpm
```

your docker will point to the Nexus instance, which will go to the [dockerhub image of centos-rpm](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/centos-rpm) and cache `centos-rpm` image.

**Example of pushing** to Docker hosted repo:
General approach is described [here](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/docker-registry/pushing-images)

I've chosen one of the available images for pushing:

### **How to fetch Helm charts from helm-proxy repo**

Once you have Helm up and running you'll want to run a command similar to the following to add a Helm repo:
```
helm repo add <helm_repository_name> http://<host>:<port>/repository/<nexus_repository_name>/ --username <username> --password <password>
```

The below command will fetch the latest chart or with the version:
```
1. helm fetch <helm_repository_name>/<chart_name>
2. helm fetch <helm_repository_name>/<chart_name> --version <chart_version>
```

For example, Nexus Repository has a Helm proxy repository called **charts.bitnami.com_bitnami** and your Nexus Repository is running on localhost:8081.
You would like to add this repository to Helm client. Also, you would like to fetch the latest MySQL chart. To accomplish this, you would do the following:

```
helm repo add bitnami http://127.0.0.1:8081/repository/charts.bitnami.com_bitnami/
helm fetch bitnami/mysql
```

If you want to fetch a chart with a specific version, just run it, like so:

```
helm fetch bitnami/mysql --version 1.4.0
```

### **How to push Helm charts to the helm-hosted repo**

![26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203764593-35fba3b3-2b69-4dfa-a3ed-5d1f6a4c3c90.png)

1) I've created test chart

2) I've checked that chart directory has been created with default content

3) Made an archive out of the chart

Then, using "helm-contributor" user with "123123123" password we can push the chart to the helm-hosted repo.
The following command should be used:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8081/service/rest/v1/components?repository=helm-hosted' \
  -u 'helm-contributor:123123123' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'helm.asset=@test_chart-0.1.0.tgz;type=application/x-compressed-tar'
```

Or we can use already downloaded chart from [bitnami/nginx](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/ce8d6cccb28878a53e8ea7c313d6fcebd49de47f/bitnami/nginx), for example:

```
❯ helm fetch bitnami/nginx

❯ ls -la
.rw-r--r-- 40k md_dzubenco_add  7 Dec 19:44 nginx-13.2.14.tgz

❯ curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8081/service/rest/v1/components?repository=helm-hosted' \
  -u 'helm-contributor:123123123' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'helm.asset=@nginx-13.2.14.tgz;type=application/x-compressed-tar'
```

##

Follow the installation instructions from [helm-nexus-push](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/helm-nexus-push) github repo to install `helm-nexus-push` plugin.

1) Install the plugin

`helm plugin install --version master https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/helm-nexus-push.git `

2) Add a helm repo which refers to your `helm hosted` repo from Nexus: 

`helm repo add helm-hosted http://127.0.0.1:8081/repository/helm-hosted/`

3) Push the chart using credentials from respective user (in my case it's `helm-contributor` user with password of `123123123`):

`helm nexus-push helm-hosted -u helm-contributor -p 123123123 postgresql-ha-10.0.7.tgz`

Name  of `postgresql-ha-10.0.7.tgz` archive is taken just as example, you should replace it with your own archive you want to push.

# Setup Maven repositories

Official documentation from Sonatype on how to proxy Maven dependencies: [link](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/maven-repositories)

<details>
<summary><h4>Setup Proxy Maven repository</h4></summary>

#

Note: Nexus has a set of Maven repositories (proxy, hosted and group types) installed by default from the box.

![27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203764657-ce64bff9-8eb4-4c89-a6ae-70c6fcca70d2.png)

```
http://localhost:8082/repository/maven-central/ - proxy for https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/
http://localhost:8082/repository/maven-snapshots/ - hosted repository for custom dependencies storage
http://localhost:8082/repository/maven-releases/ - hosted repository for custom dependencies storage
http://localhost:8082/repository/maven-public/ - group repository, includes all three above repos
```

In most cases it would be enough and you can use them to proxy your dependencies, there is no need to create a separate proxy. But in case if you need this, you can go ahead with the following steps.

![28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203764714-588b1678-2b6e-49fa-ae5d-7ebd94aeb0f4.png)

1) Go to "server administration and configuration" section

2) Choose "repositories" option on the left sidebar, then click "create repository" button at the very top of the screen

3) Choose "maven (proxy)" type

![29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203764767-7e0dcee0-26c9-401a-a5c5-38b70d00c6ec.png)

1) Provide the name of proxy

2) Provide the URL of the remote storage (for example, https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/). Note: each proxy repository can use only one remote storage

3) Please don't forget to apply to the repository the cleanup policy which has been created at the **cleanup policies section** of this guide

![30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203764848-db7adf5c-dac8-4ae5-958d-3a3b22405952.png)

As a result, repository like this should appear:

![31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203764913-d3e9ca14-bced-4b45-b3ac-51805137f092.png)

<summary><h4>Setup Hosted Maven repository</h4></summary>

#

If you want to have an ability to push your own Maven dependencies to the Nexus, you would need to have Hosted Repository set up.

The creation of Hosted Maven repository in Nexus is pretty similar to the **Proxy Maven** repository creation.

The differences are that:

1) When choosing the repository type to be created, choose "maven (hosted)"

2) Provide a name of repository, choose the blobstore (or remain it default) and apply a cleanup policy if needed (it should be set up as above at the **cleanup policies setup** section of this guide))

<details>
<summary><h4>Setup Group Maven repository</h4></summary>

#

Several Maven repositories can be grouped in order to simplify access if you're going to use different remote repositories at the same time.
For more details please refer to the [guide](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/repository-management) on repository types (group repository section).

For example, you can group both **Maven Proxy** and **Maven Hosted** repositories in the same **Maven Group** Repo:

![32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203766754-3fc100e3-0957-43a5-8596-91224b67ac67.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Client configuration & How to use</h4></summary>

#

1) In your ~/.m2/ directory create a settings.xml file and fill it with the following data (in case if it already exists, override it's content):

```
<settings>
  <mirrors>
	<mirror>
  	<!--This sends everything else to /public -->
  	<id>nexus</id>
  	<mirrorOf>external:*</mirrorOf>
	<url>http://localhost:8082/repository/maven-public/</url>
	</mirror>
  </mirrors>
</settings>
```

Now, every maven command will use the mirror identified in user's settings.xml and only after that settings from pom will be picked up. There's no need to include the path of settings.xml in the maven command after -s flag. Maven will automatically check for settings in .m2 directory.

More documentation about mirror settings can be found in the mini guide on the [Maven web site](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html).

Now, in order to check that the setting works well, you can go to directory that contain pom.xml and execute mvn package:
```
cd /...

mvn package
```

The log shown in terminal may contain URL address of specified proxy.

In case if you want to, you can explicitly define the path for settings.xml configuration file inside the maven command (-s flag) as shown below:

```
mvn -B -s $settings_xml_path -Dmaven.repo.local=$maven_repo_path install
```

*Try it yourself:*

```
git clone https://github.com/Alliedium/springboot-api-rest-example.git
cd ./springboot-api-rest-example/api
mvn install
```

<summary><h4>If you want to use Gradle as the client</h4></summary>

##

1) Create a `gradle.init` file in `~/.gradle` home directory:

```
❯ cat ~/.gradle/init.gradle
allprojects {
repositories {
   mavenLocal()
   maven {
     url 'http://127.0.0.1:8081/repository/maven-public/'
     allowInsecureProtocol = true
   }
}
}
```

Then try the following example: 

```
git clone https://github.com/zoooo-hs/realworld-springboot.git
cd realworld-springboot
./gradlew build
```

# Setup Conda repositories

Official documentation from Sonatype on how to proxy Conda dependencies: [link](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/conda-repositories)

<details>
<summary><h4>Setup Proxy Conda repository</h4></summary>

#

Note: each proxy repository can use only one remote storage (channel)

Our project is correctly using Conda Proxy repositories for the following channels:

```python
https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/
https://conda.anaconda.org/anaconda/
```

For both channels setup is similar and should be done as follows:

![33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203766876-2b2d46e1-35f2-45eb-803a-4ed9a3fcabd7.png)

1) Go to "server administration and configuration" section

2) Choose "repositories" option on the left sidebar, then click "create repository" button at the very top of the screen

3) Choose "conda (proxy)" type

![34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203766899-4187f9d7-3962-4599-8357-b4d20196496f.png)

1) Provide the name of proxy (if you are proxying a common channel, e.g. conda-forge, try to use the same name)

2) Provide the URL of remote storage (in case of conda-forge channel it's https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/)

3) (Optional, can be remained by default) Choose a blob store for the repository if you need to separate it from the default one.

4) Please don't forget to apply to the repository the cleanup policy which has been created at the **cleanup policies section** of this guide

![35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203766937-e0608ea9-a342-4a4e-9192-e5a7cdb7959b.png)

As a result, repository like this should appear:

![36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203767057-03f1b124-92ef-48dd-952d-c9e3f976e478.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Client configuration & How to use</h4></summary>

#

One of the options is to use repository URL directly in the conda (or miniconda, or micromamba) command, for example the following command:

```
micromamba install -c http://localhost:8082/repository/conda-forge/ numpy
```

downloads numpy package from conda-forge remote repository through our proxy repository.

Content of the -c flag represents URL to the Nexus repository.

The better way would be to use .condarc configuration file (more details on how to use .condarc file can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/use-condarc.html))

1) Create ~/.condarc file under your user's home directory and fill it with the content similar to the following:

```
channel_alias: http://localhost:8082/repository/
```

This alias means, that every conda command, which is including channel with *channel_name*, will be actually referring to http://localhost:8082/repository/channel_name

**Note** that currently we have proxy repositories for *conda-forge* and *anaconda* channels only:

```
https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/
https://conda.anaconda.org/anaconda/
```

So the command structure like in example below is valid (we can use these two channels without explicit mention of proxy url):

```
micromamba install pip -c conda-forge
```

Practical example:

Install micromamba:

```
yay -S micromamba-bin
micromamba shell
logout/login
```

Create and activate environment: 

```
micromamba create -n xtensor
micromamba activate xternsor
```

Clone a repo and install necessary dependencies:

```
git clone --depth 1 --branch 0.24.2 https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor.git
cd ./xtensor
micromamba install -f ./environment.yml
```

Note: each proxy repository can use only one remote storage

We will setup a proxy for the following remote storage:

```python
https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

For any other proxies the setup is similar and can be done as follows:

Go to "server administration and configuration" section -> Choose "repositories" option on the left sidebar, then click "create repository" button at the very top of the screen -> Choose "npm (proxy)" type

![37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74211642/203767181-607fd658-68a1-4d8d-b10a-3aead46e7ed8.png)

1) Provide the name of proxy

2) Provide the URL of the remote storage (for example, https://registry.npmjs.org/)

3) (Optional, can be remained by default) Choose a blob store for the repository if you need to separate it from the default one.

4) Please don't forget to apply to the repository the cleanup policy which has been created at the **cleanup policies section** of this guide

<details>
<summary><h4>Client configuration & How to use</h4></summary>

#

One of the options is to use repository URL directly in he npm command as follows:

```
npm --registry http://localhost:8082/repository/npm/ install yarn   
```

This command will download yarn package from the https://registry.npmjs.org/ remote repository and it will be cached in our proxy repository which URL was placed under --registry flag.

Also registry can be configured in the .npmrc configuration file (for more detail please refer to the following [guide](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/npm-registry/configuring-npm)):

1) Create ~/.npmrc file uder your user's home directory and fill it with the content similar to the following:

```
registry=http://localhost:8082/repository/npm-group/
_auth=YWRtaW46bmV4dXM=

```

Try the following commands to ensure that npm refers to the proxy:

```
npm install express --loglevel verbose
npm install yarn --loglevel verbose
```

Or try the following example: 

```
git clone https://github.com/mikro-orm/nestjs-realworld-example-app.git

#

## pip.conf ##

If you are going to use pip to download pip dependencies, create a pip.conf file:

1) Create a new file under your home directory **~/.config/pip/pip.conf** with the following content:
```
[global]
index-url = http://localhost:8081/repository/pypi-group/simple
trusted-host = localhost
```

Note that *http://localhost:8081/repository/pypi-group/* - is URL for my group repository which contains proxy repository for https://pypi.org/

But don't forget to add **/simple** postfix to the end of index-url

Then you can use a command like the following one to ensure that setting is working fine - log should contain URL of the proxy:
```
pip install twine 
```
---

## .pypirc ##

Note that pip doesn't use **.pypirc** at all. **.pypirc** is only used by tools that publish packages to an index (for example, twine) and pip doesn't publish packages.

If you want to upload a package to a hosted repository using twine, you would need to configure a .pypirc file:

1) Create a .pypirc file under your user's home directory **~/.pypirc** with the following content:

```
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi

[pypi]
repository = http://localhost:8081/repository/pypi-group/simple
```


Once these config files are set up, you can try the following examples: 

```
git clone https://github.com/alnuaimi94/realworld
cd realworld
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For poetry ([Learn about Poetry](https://habr.com/ru/post/593529/)):

```
git clone https://github.com/nsidnev/fastapi-realworld-example-app
cd fastapi-realworld-example-app
